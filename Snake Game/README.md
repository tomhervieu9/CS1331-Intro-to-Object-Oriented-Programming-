#The "Snake Game" is a classic videogame where a snake navigates around a square field eating items which cause him to grow in length.

#The goal of the game is to grow as large as possible without running into your own body or the walls. 

#An example of the game can be found online at http://patorjk.com/games/snake/

#I implemented this game using JavaFX.
